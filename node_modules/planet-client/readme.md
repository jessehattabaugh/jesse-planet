## planet-client

A JavaScript client for [Planet's imagery API](https://www.planet.com/docs/).

### Installation

The `planet-client` requires Node >= 0.12.  Install the `planet-client` package `npm` (which comes with [Node](https://nodejs.org/)).

    npm install planet-client

The `planet-client` package provides a library for use in your application and a `planet` executable for command line use.  See details on both below.

### Using the Library

The `planet-client` package can be used in a Node based project or in the browser with a CommonJS module loader (like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)).

The library requires a global [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) implementation.  This comes with Node >= 0.12 and [modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=promise).  To use `planet-client` in an environment without `Promise`, you can [use a polyfill](https://www.google.com/search?q=promise+polyfill).

See the `examples` directory for example use of the library.

### Using the CLI

The `planet-client` package provides a `planet` executable.  This can be installed globally (`npm install --global planet-client`), or if you install it locally, you can add the executable to your path (`export PATH=path/to/node_modules/.bin:$PATH`).

The general syntax for the `planet` executable is `planet <command> [options]`.  To see a list of commands, run the following:

    planet --help

You can get help for a specific command by adding `--help` to the command name (e.g. `planet find-scenes --help`).

To take advantage of command line completion with the `planet` executable, you can run the following in bash:

    eval "$(planet completion)"

To enable this every time you start a new shell, you can append the output of `planet completion` to your `.bashrc`:

    planet completion >> ~/.bashrc

The CLI will be fully documented when it is a bit more stable.  For now, you can get a preview of what's available with this video:

### Contributing

To get set up, clone the repository and install the development dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:planetlabs/planet-client-js.git
    cd planet-client-js
    npm install

Run the tests to ensure any changes meet the coding style and maintain the expected functionality:

    npm test

During development, you can start a file watcher that runs the linter and tests with any file changes:

    npm start

Releases are published from the master branch.  To cut a new minor release, do this:

    npm version minor && git push --tags origin master && npm publish

The `postpublish` script will update [the docs](http://planetlabs.github.io/planet-client-js/).
